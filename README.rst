The ``ml4qc`` Python package offers a toolkit for employing machine learning technologies
in survey data quality control. Among other things, it helps to extend
`the surveydata package <https://github.com/orangechairlabs/py-surveydata>`_, advance `SurveyCTO's
machine learning roadmap <https://www.surveycto.com/blog/machine-learning-for-quality-control/>`_,
and contribute to research like the following:

    **Can machine learning aid survey data quality-control efforts, even without access to actual
    survey data?**

    A robust quality-control process with some degree of human review is often crucial for survey
    data quality, but resources for human review are almost always limited and therefore rationed.
    While traditional statistical methods of directing quality-control efforts often rely on
    field-by-field analysis to check for outliers, enumerator effects, and unexpected patterns,
    newer machine-learning-based methods allow for a more holistic evaluation of interviews. ML
    methods also allow for human review to train models that can then predict the results of
    review, increasingly focusing review time on potential problems. In this paper, we present the
    results of a collaboration between research and practice that explored the potential of
    ML-based methods to direct and supplement QC efforts in several international settings. In
    particular, we look at the potential for privacy-protecting approaches that allow ML models to
    be trained and utilized without ever exposing personally-identifiable data — or, indeed, any
    survey data at all — to ML systems or analysts. Specifically, metadata and paradata, including
    rich but non-identifying data from mobile device sensors, is used in lieu of
    potentially-sensitive survey data.

Installation
------------

Installing the latest version with pip::

    pip install ml4qc

Overview
--------

The ``ml4qc`` package builds on the `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ toolset. It includes the following
utility classes for working with survey data:

* ``SurveyML`` provides core functionality, including preprocessing, outlier detection, and cluster analysis
* ``SurveyMLClassifier`` builds on ``SurveyML``, adding support for running classification models and reporting out results

While ``SurveyMLClassifier`` supports a variety of approaches, the currently-recommended
approach to binary classification is as follows:

1. Do *not* reweight for class imbalances; use
   ``SurveyMLClassifier.cv_for_best_hyperparameters()`` to find the optimal hyperparameters
   for a given dataset, with *neg_log_loss*, *neg_brier_score*, or *roc_auc* as the CV metric
   to optimize. This will optimize for an unbiased distribution of estimated probabilities.
2. Use a ``calibration_method`` (*isotonic* or *sigmoid*) to calibrate the estimated
   probability distribution.
3. Almost always (and especially when classes are imbalanced), specify a non-default option
   for the classification ``threshold`` (and possibly ``threshold_value``), as the
   default threshold of 0.5 is unlikely to be optimal. When in doubt, use
   ``threshold='optimal_f'`` to choose the threshold that maximizes the F-1 score.

This is essentially the approach used in the examples linked below.

Examples
--------

This package is best illustrated by way of example. The following example analyses are available:

* `CATI1 analysis <https://github.com/orangechairlabs/ml4qc/blob/main/src/ml4qc-cati1-example.ipynb>`_
* `CATI2 analysis <https://github.com/orangechairlabs/ml4qc/blob/main/src/ml4qc-cati2-example.ipynb>`_
* `CAPI1 analysis <https://github.com/orangechairlabs/ml4qc/blob/main/src/ml4qc-capi1-example.ipynb>`_
* `CAPI2 analysis <https://github.com/orangechairlabs/ml4qc/blob/main/src/ml4qc-capi2-example.ipynb>`_

`Dobility <https://www.surveycto.com/>`_ has generously provided financial and other support for v1 of the ``ml4qc``
package, including support for early testing and piloting.

Development
-----------

To develop locally:

#. ``git clone https://github.com/orangechairlabs/ml4qc.git``
#. ``cd ml4qc``
#. ``python -m venv venv``
#. ``source venv/bin/activate``
#. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

For convenience, the repo includes ``.idea`` project files for PyCharm.

To rebuild the documentation:

#. Update version number in ``/docs/source/conf.py``
#. Update layout or options as needed in ``/docs/source/index.rst``
#. In a terminal window, from the project directory:
    a. ``cd docs``
    b. ``SPHINX_APIDOC_OPTIONS=members,show-inheritance sphinx-apidoc -o source ../src/ml4qc --separate --force``
    c. ``make clean html``

To rebuild the distribution packages:

#. For the PyPI package:
    a. Update version number (and any build options) in ``/setup.py``
    b. Confirm credentials and settings in ``~/.pypirc``
    c. Run ``/setup.py`` for ``bdist_wheel`` build type (*Tools... Run setup.py task...* in PyCharm)
    d. Delete old builds from ``/dist``
    e. In a terminal window:
        i. ``twine upload dist/* --verbose``
#. For GitHub:
    a. Commit everything to GitHub and merge to ``main`` branch
    b. Add new release, linking to new tag like ``v#.#.#`` in main branch
#. For readthedocs.io:
    a. Go to https://readthedocs.org/projects/ml4qc/, log in, and click to rebuild from GitHub (only if it doesn't automatically trigger)
